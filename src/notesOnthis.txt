		this.title=title; // this.title is global variable, and title is a local variable
		title=filmTitle; // This is similar to  this.title=filmTitle , but using this. prefix is not compulsory
		director=filmDirector; // This is similar to  this.director=filmDirector, but using this. prefix is not compulsory
			// As there are no ;local variables by name title, or director 
			// So ,here they will implicitly refer to global variable
			// Note : If title and director are not globally declare then it will be undeclared variable
			// if the parameter names are similar to the global variables
			// then there is an ambiguity between local variable the local variable(parameters) and global variable
			// hence this. prefix is used for referring the global variable
			// title=title will be referring he local variable on both side of the = operator (x=x) self assigning
